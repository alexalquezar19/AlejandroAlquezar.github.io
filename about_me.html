									<p>Hello! My name is Alejandro Alquezar Pitarch. I was born in Barcelona on March 8, 2000. I lived in Barcelona for 7 years before my family decided to move to Valls, where I currently reside. Since childhood, I have been fascinated by technology and video games. Additionally, I am a big fan of sports, particularly Football, Formula One, Basketball, and Tennis. My interest has always leaned towards the technical aspects of sports and improving performance. It wasn't until I was in university that I realized I wanted to pursue this passion professionally. </p>
									<p>After completing the Baccalaureate (Spanish Post-16 Education, comparable to A-levels in the UK), I decided to pursue a degree in Telecommunications Technologies and Services Engineering at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya in Barcelona. However, it wasn't the right fit for me, and after a year, I decided to switch to Computer Engineering at the Universitat de Barcelona. It was during my statistics course there that I discovered a genuine interest in data and aspired to become a data analyst. Consequently, after two years, I decided to change my academic focus and began studying Data Science at Universidad Internacional de la Rioja (UNIR).</p>
									<p>During the Data Science degree, which I am currently pursuing, I have studied database management, data processing, multivariate analysis, probability models, networks and security, data structures, and ethics and data protection, among others. All of this has been done using Python and R for data analysis and SQL for database management. </p>
									<p>Additionally, during my free time, I have completed various paid courses and certificates through Coursera and Codecademy. These are the most relevant ones: <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics">Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate</a> || <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/3B3LLERG5URW">Certificate of Completion</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst">IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate </a>|| <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/BQMTUFMDPUJM">Certificate of Completion</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/learn-sql-basics-data-science"> Specialized program: Learn the fundamentals of SQL for data science By University of California, Davis</a> || <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/BFTUH5YGA7D2">Certificate of Completion</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-analyst">Data Scientist: Analytics Specialist</a> || <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/alejandroAlquezarPitarch9233223289/certificates/5ff882c953c2ed000e17bf1d">Certificate of Completion</a></li></p>
